Title:  Courera.org Course Project
Description:  Collect, work with and clean a data set from a smartphone capturing six activities. 
Date:  August 2014
Author:  Neena Davies
Purpose:  This document explains how all the scripts work and how they are connected.
==========================================================================

Brief Summary
The code in run_analysis.R basically does the following: 
1.  Gets the test and train files of activity data and combines them together
2.  Gets the associated Activity for the test and train file and combines them together
3.  It attaches the column name Activity to the Activity data.
4.  Extracts the columns that are associated with standard deviation and the mean.
5.  Assigns labels to the Activity values, e.g. 1 becomes WALKING, so that the Activity labels are more readable.
6.  Column names are attached to the top of the data, so the file is more readable. 
7.  All the individual files are combined together, including Dataactivity as the first column. 
8.  Export the cleaned data to a file.

Note: none of the data related to the values was changed in any way.  


Dataset includes the following files: 
=====================================
- run_analysis.R - code and comments on how the manipulation occurred.
- CodeBook.md - listing variables and column names and any additional data.
- README.md - this doc, giving instructions on what occurred, which can also be seen in the comments in the run_analysis.R file.

Also for reference the README.txt file from the experiment is listed below:

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
